      <p>I want to become a web developer because I'm interested in getting closer to how a computer works for both my professional and personal life. Coding is used for complex musical and visual ideas I have that I am unable to adequately do without some coding knowledge. I have also worked for the State of Washington for 5 years now, and I am ready for a career change. </p>
